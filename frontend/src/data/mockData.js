    summary:
      "Hi, I'm Q! Senior Software Engineer (full-stack) with 12 years building and operating real-time, AI-assisted products at scale. I design resilient, high-performance UIs (React 18 concurrent features, RSC/SSR/ISR, streaming with backoff/resume, WebSockets/WebRTC) and reliable backends (Node/FastAPI, GraphQL/REST, queues). I operationalize LLM features (eval harnesses, guardrails, rollback) and enforce privacy & compliance (SOC 2, PCI, HIPAA-aligned). I invest in observability, SLOs, and cost control so features stay fast, safe, and sustainable.",
